# Attendance-Helper
So this project named "Attendance Helper"ğŸ—£ is based on Django+Facerecognition modelğŸ‘€. This webapp recognise the moving faces present on screen and if the face is matched with its database then it gonna save the names of students present in class in a Excel sheet.

It makes easier for teachers to take attendance as they just have to ask students to turn on the camera and BoomğŸ’¥ everything will be done by our webapp.
Students don't have to write in chatbox or even open their mouth between the classesğŸ˜‰

Even tho it's made for a professional work then also teacher have to be attentive while our webapp will be taking attendance so that any student don't put image of himself instead of being actually present.
Give it a star if you liked it :)
